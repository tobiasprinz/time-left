Remember "Inside the mind of a master procrastinator"?
If not, watch it (again): [Inside the mind of a master procrastinator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU)
It is, allegedly, the most successful TED talk ever. Or maybe in the second TED decade. I won't look it up - that's too risky for a master procrastinator.

 Anyway: Do you wanna to be reminded how much time you have left? Use this. It's a command line script with two input parameters and three modes:

 ## Input
`--date-of-birth=YYYY-MM-DD`:
 	The only sensible date format.

 `--life-expectation=YY`:
 	Yeah, I am not calculating this here, just enter 80. 

 ## Output
 `Default mode`:
 	Text with lived weeks, weeks left and a percentage.

 `--print-blocks`:
 	prints blocks for every week of you life, empty for future ones.

 `--short`:
 	Short form.
 	For those people that like to put it into their system command prompt.

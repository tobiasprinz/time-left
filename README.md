# time-left
Remember "Inside the mind of a master procrastinator"?
If not, watch it (again): [Inside the mind of a master procrastinator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU)
It is, allegedly, the most successful TED talk ever. Or maybe the second TED decade. I cannot be bothered to look it up.

 Anyway: Do you wanna to be reminded how much time you have left? Use this.
